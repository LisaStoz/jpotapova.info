<h1>Education</h1>
<p>I have always enjoyed studying, analysing and truly understanding the
  concepts I am working with. After finishing University I have never stopped
  learning myself and I also completed lots of various courses on web
  development topics.</p>

        but also most of the time I was Nr.1 student of the entire course and
        during all 4 years of studies received an Enlarged Grant for high study
