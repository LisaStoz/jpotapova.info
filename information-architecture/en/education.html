<h1>Education</h1>
<p>I have always enjoyed studying, analysing and truly understanding the
  concepts I am working with. After finishing University I have never stopped
  learning myself and I also completed lots of various courses on web
  development topics.</p>

      <td>Computer Science, Bachelor's degree</td>
      <td>Vilnius University</td>
      <td>2006 &mdash; 2010</td>
      <td>I studied Computer Science full-time in Vilnius University Faculty of
        Mathematics and Informatics. Not only I enjoyed this period of my life,
        but also most of the time I was Nr.1 student of the entire course and
        during all 4 years of studies received an Enlarged Grant for high study
        results.
      </td>
      <td>Took part in III (2006-2007) - XII Open Team Programming Collegiate
        Cup. Learnt: C, C++, Java, Prolog, Assembly, Pascal, Object Pascal,
        Database Management Systems, SQL, MySQL, PL/SQL, Matlab, Maple, PHP and
        lots more.
        <p>
        Some of my interesting projects</p>
        <ul>
          <li>In C developed a client
        application and a server application, which allowed 2 clients to connect
         and play chess.
       </li>
       <li>Using Java created an artificial procedural language
         and developed a translator for it.
       </li><li>Using Borland Delphi developed a
         computer emulator and operating system for it. Operating system was
         able to run basic programs written in specific assembly-like language,
          accept input and provide output. It was demonstrating how it is using
          its internal resources.
        </li>
        <li>Using Java developed a set of applications
          implementing various steganographic methods</li></ul>.

      <td>Lithuanian School for Young Mathematicians is a remote studies
        programme maintained by Vilnius University Faculty of Mathematics and
        Informatics with a final problem-solving competition held in Vilnius
        University. The programme covers various mathematical topics and
        problems that are more complex that the ones required for the
        Final National Exams, in fact, it is a serious preparation for Maths
        and Computer Science Studies in Vilnius University.
        I completed the programme in addition to my Secondary Education.</td>
