<h1>Experience</h1>
<p>Currently I have 7 years of commercial experience.
  During these years I did some freelancing, worked in small startups and large companies.
  I created my first programme long before I finished school - at the age of 13.
   Since then I programmed every day, which is now more than half of my life.</p>
