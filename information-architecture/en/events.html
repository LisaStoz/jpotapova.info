<h1>Events</h1>
<p>I like to speak, share my skills with an audience and coach young developers.
   Below is a list of events I took part in as a presenter, organiser or a coach.
    For my talks I prepare all the content myself and carefully select the
    exercises. Sometimes I also enjoy to take part in programming competitions.</p>

       the basics of Jasmine framework. For the competition I prepared a
       selection of katas and participants were invited to write quality tests
       for each of the exercise.
