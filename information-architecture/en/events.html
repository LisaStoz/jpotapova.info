<h1>Events</h1>
<p>I like to speak, share my skills with an audience and coach young developers.
   Below is a list of events I took part in as a presenter, organiser or a coach.
    For my talks I prepare all the content myself and carefully select the
    exercises. Sometimes I also enjoy to take part in programming competitions.</p>
