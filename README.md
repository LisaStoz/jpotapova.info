# Personal Website - Portfolio - CV

This a source code of my personal website, where I list my skills, achievements, projects, etc.

It is a simple static website pre-compiled with [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
and is built with [Foundation 5](http://foundation.zurb.com/) and [Assemble](http://assemble.io/).

For customisation I am using [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), for content management - just json files,
as I organised my Grunt assemble task in a way to make this very easy.

Colours taken from [Stonehenge colour palette](http://www.colourlovers.com/palette/101411/Stonehenge).
